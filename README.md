# Pension Prognosis: Predicting German Pensions Using Synthetic Data

## Overview

"Pension Prognosis" is a work-in-progress project. I aim to forecast the fictional development of pensions in Germany using synthetic data. The goal is to understand the German pension system and, in my fictional scenario, predict future pension payments based on demographic and economic factors.

## Project Structure

The main components of the project are:

- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Exploration and visualization of datasets to derive initial insights.
- **data:** Contains the synthetically generated datasets used for analyses.
- **src:** Source code for data processing, modeling, and evaluation.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aneifer/pension_prognosis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:​**

```bash
   cd pension_prognosis
```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):​**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. **Install the required dependencies:​**

```bash
